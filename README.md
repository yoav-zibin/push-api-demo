# push-api-demo

This is an attempt to create a simple chatroom example to demonstrate the [Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API). It also illustrates some uses of [Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API), and how to use [Channel Messaging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Channel_Messaging_API) to communicate data between a Service Worker and the main window context.

## Current status

At the moment this demo only works on [Firefox Nightly](https://nightly.mozilla.org/). The working parts are:

* Requesting permission to send notifications/push messages.
* Registering and activating a service worker to handle the Push/Channel Messages.
* Subscribing/unsubscribing (to/from) the push sevice.
* Sending a push message from the server.
* Sending messages to and from the SW via a message channel.
* Receiving a push message in the SW via the `onpush` handler and firing a notification and sending a channel message as a result.

See [Using the Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API/Using_the_Push_API) for more details about how this works.

## Still to do

* Hosting the server somewhere on t'internet so it can be accessed by multiple users (a chatroom is pretty useless with only one user!)
* Improving the Node server so that it will handle the push messages, AND serve the static files. This is needed for it to start working on Chrome (and Chrome doesn't yet support the PushMessageData either.)


## Running the demo

To get it running:


1. Make sure you are using [Firefox Nightly](https://nightly.mozilla.org/).
2. Clone this repo locally (you'll need to [install git](http://www.git-scm.com/downloads, then use the command `git clone https://github.com/chrisdavidmills/push-api-demo.git`)).
3. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) on your computer.
4. Install Marco Castelluccio's [web-push library](https://github.com/marco-c/web-push) using the command `npm install web-push`.
5. Load the [sample app](https://chrisdavidmills.github.io/push-api-demo/) in Firefox Nightly. Note that it needs to run under HTTPS, as Service workers will only run in a secure context.
6. in your terminal/command line, navigate to the directory that you cloned this repo into, and run the command `node server` to start the same server running. This server is HTTPS, and runs at `127.0.0.1:7000`.
7. Before using the demo functionality, navigate to [https://127.0.0.1:7000](https://127.0.0.1:7000) and accept the unknown SSL certificate mentioned.
7. Go back to the sample app and play with the subscribe/unsubscribe functionality and sending of chat messages. Monitor the browser console and terminal window (that the server is running in) to see what is happening. You will also see user information being written into, and removed from, the [endpoint.txt](https://github.com/chrisdavidmills/push-api-demo/blob/gh-pages/endpoint.txt) file as subscribe/unsubscribe commands are issued.

Note: Some of the client-side code in this demo is heavily influenced by Matt Gaunt's excellent examples in [Push Notifications on the Open Web](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2015/03/push-notificatons-on-the-open-web). Thanks for the awesome work Matt!
